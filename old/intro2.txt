Built across the galaxies was a great city that was called Jerusalem.
   This was the city of hope & dreams,
   forever in motion,
   changing with the drift of the nebulae in the solar wind,
   yet retaining its essence.
In that city all were citizens & all were kings.

XXXX Above all ART, SCIENCE, and WISDOM were valued. XXXX

But strife came to the city, and with strife came sickness.

Thus you, the giant ANTHROPOS, fell into a feverish sleep
   and the city was torn apart
   XX for the city is the PEOPLE, and people are the CITY. XX
